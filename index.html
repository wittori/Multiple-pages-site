    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <h2>
      A French Croissant is instantly recognizable with its crescent shape that
      is golden brown and so buttery crisp and flaky. When you cut into one
      you'll find the dough has formed a beautiful honeycomb design with a
      texture that's wonderfully soft. Yes, you can make them at home. While
      it's a little time consuming, because of all the rest times, it's worth
      every minute. And once you master the basic dough, you can make plain
      Croissants, Chocolate Croissants (pain au chocolat), Danish Pastries, as
      well as a host of other sweet and savory pastries. And Croissants that are
      a few days old can be used to make Almond Croissants (croissants aux
      amandes).
